## 1. Shapes
 Use for draw buttons, keyboards, and particles.
 ```
button <- rect, triangle(to make Home mark)
keyboards <- rect
speech bubble <- rect, triangle(will draw no stroke)
explanation box <- rect
particle <- vertex(to draw star. I'll use particle class that I made before.)
 ```

----

## 2. Colors
Basically I'll use **pink and red color**.
```
I want to give off a soft, warm and bright feeling.
And I didn't used colors that hurt my eyes.

(RGB)
background pink: (255, 200, 200)

               default      curser on the button       button is pressed
button color:   (255)    ->    (255, 230, 230)    ->    (240, 160, 160)

                           default           button is pressed
button stroke color:   (200, 120, 120)   ->   (180, 100, 100)

particle color: (255, random(155~255), random(155~255))
        => It return like pink, yellow, golden sand, pastel magenta, and white.

explanation box color: (255, 170)
explanation box stroke color: (255, 210, 210)

                  default        button is clicked   'LIFE' text color
text color:   (180, 100, 100),         (255),               (0)

                  white / black   if code is play
keyboard color:   (255),   (0),   (255, 90, 110)
```

    }
```

- function keyPressed (keyPressed.js | line 19~175, 178~232)
```
    If you press key [Z S X D C V G B H N J M],
    plays each code and push the code in musicA array.

    If you press Enter key, new question is made.
    Arrays of previous question is all reset.

    And If you fail the level, press Enter key, you can retry that level.
```
```

- function mouseReleased (mouseReleased.js)
```
    If you click button, click SFX is played, changed current page,
    and buttons' color changed from pale pink to dried rose color.

    In Shop page, if click play button("â–¶"), sample sound of each instrument is played.
    At that time, background music is paused.
    After sample sound is end, background music is played again.
    And if you have more than 50 golds, you can buy celesta or accordion sound.
    If you have less than 50 golds, you can click buy button but can't buy. Just SFX played.

    Like buy button on shop page, you can't select another level before clear previous level.

    like these.
```

- class musicQuestion (musicQuestion.js | line 39~66, 92~96, 99~118, 126~130)
```
    If code sound is playing, the corresponding color of the key
    changed from white or black to hot pink.

    And case of black keys, third space is no key,
    so draw black keys without third key with for loop and conditional statement.
```
```
    if(pianoC.isPlaying() === true || celestaC.isPlaying() === true || accordionC.isPlaying() === true)
    {
        rect(x+1, y, (white_key_width*0.5), (white_key_height*0.5));

    like these.
```


- class musicAnswer (musicAnswer.js | line 30~62, 74~81, 84~103, 107~111)
```
    If you press the keys of piano keyboard, the corresponding color of the key
    changed from white or black to hot pink.

    And likewise class musicQuestion, draw black keys without third key
    with for loop and conditional statement.
```
```
    if(keyIsPressed === true)
    {
        if(key === 'z')

    like these.
```


 - function updateLevel 1~4 (updateLevel.js | line 10~25, 34~52, 61~82, 91~115)
 ```
    To use conditional statement, apply to play the sound of the selected instrument.
 ```
 ```
     if(current_instrument === "PIANO")
    {
        musicQ_sound.push(random(PianoCode));
        musicQ_sound.push(random(PianoCode));

        musicQ_sound.push(random(AccordionCode));
        musicQ_sound.push(random(AccordionCode));
    }

    like this.
 ```


 - function make_musicQ_array (updateLevel.js | line 232~268)
 ```
    For compare question and your answer, make question's array to use conditional statement.
    Array musicQ_sound is an array of sound files, so can't compare.
    So make another array to compare.
 ```
 ```
    if(musicQ_sound[i] == pianoC || musicQ_sound[i] == celestaC || musicQ_sound[i] == accordionC)
    {
        musicQ.push("codeC");

 ```
    To use conditional statement, compare musicQ array and musicA array.

    If correspond that arrays, count_correctAnswer is increases 1, and played right_SFX.
    And if clear that level(count_correctAnswer is 10),
    particles are drawn, played clap_SFX, and you get golds.

    If not correspond, life is decreases 1, and played wrong_SFX.
 ```
 ```
    if(musicA.length === i+1 && musicQ[i] !== musicA[i])

    like this.
 ```

 - to remove particles (sketch.js | line 106~109)
 ```
    If star particles goes out to canvas, remove particles,
    to reduce the amount of data occupied.
 ```
 ```
    if(particle.position.x > width || particle.position.x<0 || particle.position.y > height)
    {
        particleStar.splice(i, 1);
    }
 ```

----

## 5. Loops
I used only for loop.
  - to draw and remove particle
  ```
    for(let Particle of particleStar)                       //sketch.js | line 97
    for(let i = particleStar.length-1; i>=0; --i)           //sketch.js | line 103
  ```
  - to draw keyboard (both character's and player's)        
  ```
    for(let column=0; column < 7; column++) //white key
    for(let column = 0; column < 6; column++) //black key

    //musicQuestion.js | line 33, 71, 90, 124
    //musicAnswer.js | line 23, 57, 72, 105
  ```
  - to play question sound and sample sound of instrument
  ```
    for(let i=0; i< musicQ_sound.length; i++)               //updateLevel.js | line 123
    for(let i = 0; i < sample_piano.length; i++)            //mouseReleased.js | line 57

    like these.
  ```

## 6. Functions
 - Button (function.js | line 7~47)
 ```
    Button function has the parameters of button's size and text.
    So it can use when I made any button anywhere.
 ```

 - HomeMark (function.js | line 50~60)
 ```
    It only used 'go to main page' button.
    It drawn on the button.
 ```

 - speechBubble (function.js | line 63~94)
 ```
    It is a function to draw speech bubble and texts in that each level.
    It drawn under the character's keyboard.
 ```

 - playing_character (function.js | line 96~118)
 ```
    Character's arms are move once a second, like playing instrument.
    And the face changes depending on the result.
    There is no particular function, just to decorate the screen,
    and in order to provide visual familiarity.
 ```

 - explanation_box (function.js | line 120~130)
 ```
    In SelectLevel page, if your mouse curser is on the level button,
    explanation box is drawn.
    Because the descriptions vary each level, so added the parameter about text.
 ```

 - life (function.js | line 132~146)
 ```
    It draw life you have as heart shape.
    If you press wrong code, life is decrease 1.
 ```

 - star_particle_effect (function.js | line 149~158)
 ```
    If you clear level, particles of star shape are drawn.
    The color of particles is random(red, white, pink, yellow, pastel purple...)
 ```

    What_Key_B = ["S", "D", "", "G", "H", "J"];
    What_Key_W = ["Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N", "M"];
    ```
 - To draw particles
    ```
    particleStar = [];
    ```

          = [accordionC, accordionCs, accordionD, accordionDs, accordionE, accordionF, accordionFs, accordionG, accordionGs, accordionA, accordionAs, accordionB];
    ```

 - To compare question and answer, and judgement
    ```
        musicQ = [];
          : push codes randomly every level, every question.

        musicA = [];
          : if you press keyboard, push corresponding codes every level, every question.
