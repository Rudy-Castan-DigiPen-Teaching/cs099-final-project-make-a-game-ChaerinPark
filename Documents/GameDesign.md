## Theme : Take One, Leave The Rest

There are 4 levels, and it's getting harder as the level goes up.

And if you success that level, you can choose any level between you done success.

    - If you clear Level 1, Level 2 is opened. And you can choose 'keep going' or 'return to select level'.

    - If you choose keep going, you can play Level 2 right now, else if you choose 'return to select level', you can select between Level 1 and 2.

    - After clear Level 2, Level 3 is opened so you can choose between Level 1, 2 and 3.
